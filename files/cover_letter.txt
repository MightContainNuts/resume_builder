Dear [Hiring Manager's Name],

I am writing to express my interest in the Engineering Manager position at [Company's Name] in Munich, as advertised. With a solid background in software engineering and management, bolstered by relevant certifications in Agile methodologies, data science, and AI, I believe I am well-suited to contribute to your mission of delivering innovative solutions in the travel industry.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and have extensive experience as a Senior Engineering Manager at Payoneer, where I successfully led cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality technical solutions. My expertise in Agile methodologies, particularly Scrum and Kanban, has enabled me to foster a collaborative team culture, greatly enhancing productivity and engagement among team members. Additionally, I have a proven track record of overseeing the development of backend applications using Java and Python, which aligns with your requirements for proficiency in Java/Kotlin/Spring.

I am also certified in agile project management and have completed several courses in data science and machine learning, including the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and Python for Data Science, AI & Development. These skills allow me to integrate data-driven decision-making into technical strategies effectively, enhancing project outcomes.

Throughout my career, I have successfully partnered with product and design teams to define project goals and roadmaps, ensuring alignment with business objectives. I have also demonstrated technical leadership through system design, architecture planning, and code reviews, which are critical skills for the Engineering Manager role. My ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders has been instrumental in driving strategic tech decisions and project success.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to own the tech domain and contribute to your team’s growth. The potential for a mini-ownership stake with stock options is an appealing aspect that reflects your commitment to employee engagement and company growth.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm align with the goals of your team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your innovative projects and helping drive user satisfaction in your dynamic network.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
